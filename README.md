# SleepDataAnalysis

According to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, "sleep patterns change as you age", and "varies significantly across individuals of the same age". Keeping this in mind, it is interesting to understand what times many people at ASU, whether students or faculty, go to bed at night.
Though these statistics and findings don't incorporate what time people are waking up, it is interesting to note what time they are 'attempting' to fall alseep.

A survey asking the simple question, "During which time frame do you usually go to bed? (Attempt to fall asleep. No devices or interference.)" was conducted earlier this month (October 2021).

The file dataVisualization houses the information for these results.
